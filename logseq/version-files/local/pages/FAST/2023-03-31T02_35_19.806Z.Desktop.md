- ## Overview
  collapsed:: true
	- Welcome to the **Free Appropriate Sustainable Technology (FAST)** research group run by Professor [Joshua Pearce](https://www.appropedia.org/User:J.M.Pearce), the Thompson Chair in Information Technology and Innovation at the [Thompson Centre for Engineering Leadership & Innovation](https://www.eng.uwo.ca/tc/). He holds appointments at [Ivey Business School](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/), the top ranked business school in Canada and the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.eng.uwo.ca/electrical/) at [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca/) in Canada, a top 1% global university. [Western is ranked #3 in the world for sustainability](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/rankings/impact/2022/overall#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/undefined). FAST helps Western achieve its sustainability goals as we explore the way solar [photovoltaic](https://www.appropedia.org/Photovoltaic) technology can sustainably power our society and how [open-source hardware](https://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_hardware) like [open source appropriate technologies](https://www.appropedia.org/Open_source_appropriate_technologies) (or OSAT) and [RepRap](https://www.appropedia.org/RepRap) 3-D printing can drive distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM) (and maybe even social change).

- ## Overview
  collapsed:: true
	- Welcome to the **Free Appropriate Sustainable Technology (FAST)** research group run by Professor [Joshua Pearce](https://www.appropedia.org/User:J.M.Pearce), the Thompson Chair in Information Technology and Innovation at the [Thompson Centre for Engineering Leadership & Innovation](https://www.eng.uwo.ca/tc/). He holds appointments at [Ivey Business School](https://www.ivey.uwo.ca/), the top ranked business school in Canada and the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.eng.uwo.ca/electrical/) at [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca/) in Canada, a top 1% global university. [Western is ranked #3 in the world for sustainability](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/rankings/impact/2022/overall#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/undefined). FAST helps Western achieve its sustainability goals as we explore the way solar [photovoltaic](https://www.appropedia.org/Photovoltaic) technology can sustainably power our society and how [open-source hardware](https://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_hardware) like [open source appropriate technologies](https://www.appropedia.org/Open_source_appropriate_technologies) (or OSAT) and [RepRap](https://www.appropedia.org/RepRap) 3-D printing can drive distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM) (and maybe even social change).

- ## [[Meeting Notes]]
	- [[Jan 31st, 2023]]
		- #AMBB paper submitted
		- #[[Hypochlorous Acid Generation (HOCl)]] gearbox in progress
	- [[Feb 14th, 2023]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Top priority is HOCl, come up with stuff that will help
			- Apoorv for material science for electrodes
			- Apoorv for resin printing the pump
			- Buy scientific pump
			- Fully kit out resin station
				- Print platforms
				- Resin tanks
		- Email to Pearce:
			- Sink, is there literally anyway to accelerate that? I can talk to Mike if needed on Thursday.
			- Hourly over summer exclusively for things directly related to HOCl
	- [[May 2nd, 2023]]
	  collapsed:: true
		- Mini press almost there
			- Needs adjustments to enclosure and hardware to accommodate cooling
			- Needs some work in terms of usability
			- Not going to do anything fancy, but as I've went I have a decent list/plan of things to upgrade
				- Warrants it's own paper which would be more thorough in terms of controls and user useability
		- Big press needs time and consultation (Prof. Gerry Moschopoulos)
			- Almost 12kW (scary)
			- Might need to use different control method (SCRs with phase control)
			- Single phase versus three phase? 120V vs 240V vs ??
			- It is going to absolutely need CSA approval and possibly more (I will find out)
			- *They will want an ESA, ask if he can stamp things (PE)*
		- CSA approval (big press and in general)
			- What's the plan for all the hardware in the lab?
			- Method for Appropedia, also a general electrical one and such
		- Need to shift priority to heating power supplies before HOCl
			- Also my job, fellowship etc.
			- I have 4 classes worth with Pearce as my plan stands
		- HOCl other(s) working on the subsystems like pumping, containment, separation, etc.
			- Use BREAD components
			- I can focus on the electrochem, resin printing, and system integration
				- Parallel to masters stuff possibly related to digital manufacture of conductors and circuits using electroplating and electrophoretic deposition
		- Power cords cannot be used in lab
			- According to EFS
			- Must get special approved ones with the floor/wall conduit from Mike Gaylard
				- I have an existing relationship
			- Ordering through Eric was issue since he wasn't aware of rule
		- Grow wall and resin corner
			- Those really cannot go beside each other, in terms of inspection and just in general
			- Clear out the junk area by sorting out and dismantling all the good material then all the crap can get pawned off to the clubs through my roles as VP

	- ## Background
		- Hypochlorous acid (HOCl or HClO) is a weak acid that naturally occurs in
		   many living organisms including humans. Hypochlorous acid is non-toxic 
		  and has the ability to disable many different pathogens and 
		  microorganisms. The advantage of using hypochlorous acid as a 
		  disinfectant is that it can be produced in-situ via the electrolysis of 
		  an aqueous sodium chloride solution; simply put, it can be made by 
		  directing an electric current through a salt water solution. This allows
		   for the production of a powerful disinfectant that doesn't require the 
		  use of expensive or complicated industrial equipment. The goal of this 
		  literature review is to collect the background information required to 
		  design and build an open-source hypochlorous acid generator that can be 
		  used at both the consumer and institutional level.9

			- **Abstract:** Electrolytic production of hypochlorite in very 
			  dilute chloride solutions is investigated using platinum and iridium 
			  oxide coated titanium expanded metal electrodes as anodes. The 
			  dependence of the hypochlorite production rate on temperature, chloride 
			  concentration and current density was determined. It was found that the 
			  hypochlorite production rate is consistently higher on iridium oxide 
			  coated titanium compared to platinum coated titanium electrodes.
			- **Investigates the electrolytic production of hypochlorite for very dilute chloride solutions**
			- **Relevant results:**
				- Hypochlorite production rate is consistently higher on iridium 
				  oxide coated titanium compared to platinum coated titanium electrodes
				- The chlorine production rate increases with increasing chloride concentration
				- Current efficiency increases with chloride concentration
				- This result is important when considering which is the limiting resource (reactant versus energy)
				- IrO2 electrode had a remarkable reduction in the active chlorine production rate between 23 and 30 degree C
				- This strong reduction in the active chlorine production rate 
				  over a small temperature range was not observed at higher chloride 
				  concentrations
				- The active chlorine production rate decreased with increased in temperature
				- This depends strongly on chloride concentration
				- Linear increase in the production rate with increasing current density
				- At lower current densities:
				- Slight increase in the active chlorine production rate
				- Once higher current densities are reached the active chlorine production rate flatlines
				- Chlorine decay rate strongly depends on the temperature and pH
				- Does not appear to depend on concentration of active chlorine
				- An exponential increase in the reaction rate of chlorine decay with increasing temperature
			- **Key information:**
				- Two steps for electrolytic hypochlorite production:
				- Primary oxidation of chloride to chlorine at the anode surface:
				- 2 Cl- → Cl2 + 2e-
				- Solution phase reaction:
				- Cl2(aq) + H2O → HClO + Cl- + H+
				- In very dilute solutions a relatively large amount of chlorine 
				  produced rapidly reacts with oxidizable agents in the water and the 
				  apparatus in a process known as chlorine decay/consumption
				- A major problem in accurately determining the exact amount of active chlorine produced
				- All type of water have a chlorine demand which is the quantity of 
				  chlorine that will react with the inorganics and organic impurities 
				  contained within that water
				- Active chlorine can only forme once the chlorine demand of the water must be satisfied (breakpoint chlorination)
				- The formation of calcareous deposits on the cathode is an issue to be aware of and is a result of OH- being produced
				- 2 H2O + 2 e- → H2 + 2 OH-
				- The OH- causes an increase in pH which leads to the deposits:
				- Ca2+ + HCO3- + OH- → CaCO3 + H2O
				- Mg2+ + 2 OH- → Mg(OH)2
				- Chlorate formation from hypochlorite and hypochlorous acid is another issue to be aware of
				- The formation follows the equation:
				- ClO- + 2 HClO → ClO3- + 2 HCl
				- Chlorate formation increases with solution temperature
			- **Important terms:**
				- Hypochlorite = hypochlorous acid + hypochlorite anion
				- Active chlorine = chlorine + hypochlorous acid + hypochlorite
				- Cl2, HClO and ClO-
				- In the pH range 6-9, the active chlorine is almost entirely hypochlorous acid (HClO) and hypochlorite (ClO-)
			- **Device specifications:**
				- Geometrical area of electrodes used:
					- Platinum: 100 mm X 30 mm
					- Iridium oxides: 113 mm X 30 mm
				- Both coatings were applied to 1 mm thick expanded titanium metal
				- Anolyte and catholyte were divided by a Nafion 450 cation exchange 
				  membrane to prevent the reduction of the produced hypochlorite at the 
				  cathode
				- The electrode distance: 5 mm
				- Reaction compartment volumes:
					- Anolyte compartment: 1250 cm^3
					- Catholyte compartment: 280 cm^3

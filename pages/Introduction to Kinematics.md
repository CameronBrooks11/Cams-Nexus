# Chapter 11: Introduction to Dynamics
- ## Overview
- Dynamics is the part of mechanics that deals with bodies in motion, as opposed to statics which focuses on bodies at rest.
- ## Historical Background
- The study of statics dates back to Greek philosophers.
- Dynamics, as a formal study, began with Galileo (1564–1642) and was further developed by Newton (1642–1727).
- ## Components of Dynamics
- **Kinematics**
	- Focuses on the geometry of motion.
	- Deals with displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time without considering the cause of motion.
- **Kinetics**
	- Studies the relationship between forces, mass, and motion.
	- Predicts motion caused by forces or determines forces required for a specific motion.
- ## Dynamics of Particles (Chapters 11 to 14)
- Early chapters focus on particles, treating bodies as single units without considering rotation.
- Later chapters address dynamics of rigid bodies, considering rotational aspects.
- ## Chapter 11: Kinematics of Particles
- Analyzes the motion of particles, initially treated as single units regardless of size.
- Initial focus on rectilinear motion: position, velocity, acceleration in straight-line movement.
- Topics include:
	- General methods for analyzing particle motion.
	- Special cases: uniform motion and uniformly accelerated motion.
	- Relative motion between particles.
	- Graphical methods for problem-solving in rectilinear motion.

- ## Design Objectives
	- **Objective 1:** Design and validate a miniature version of the precious plastics press for converting waste plastic regrind into high-quality plastic stock (sheets, bricks, etc.) to serve as raw material for construction and manufacturing.
	- **Objective 2:** Create a device that is capable of performing material science studies.
	- **Objective 3:** Provide an openly accessible and thoroughly documented design that can be recreated by the average typical user of the device.
- ## Design Concept and Development
	- **Initial Concept:** A small-scale hot and cold press for scientists to manufacture material science samples to  composites. Two 1'x1' steel platens supported by a steel frame with legs such that a bottle jack can sit below the two parallel steel platens to press them to press them together.
	- **Design Development:** [Describe the development process of the design] *(Explain how the design is evolved and refined)*
	- **Prototyping and Testing:** [Describe the prototyping and testing plans] *(Detail the plans for creating and testing prototypes)*

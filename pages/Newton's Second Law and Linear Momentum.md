# Newton's Second Law and Linear Momentum
- ## Introduction
- Newton's first and third laws are pivotal in statics for analyzing bodies at rest.
- Dynamics requires Newton's second law when bodies are accelerated.
- Accelerated bodies experience changes in velocity magnitude or direction.
- ## Newton’s Second Law
- Describes the relationship between forces and motion of particles.
- If a particle experiences a non-zero resultant force, it accelerates proportionally to the force's magnitude and direction.
- The mass of the particle is determined by the ratio of resultant force to acceleration.
- Newton's second law can be formulated as \( F = ma \).
- ### Experimentation and Understanding
- Experiments with forces of varying magnitudes and directions demonstrate this law.
- Acceleration of a particle is directly proportional to the applied force.
- ### Application in Engineering Problems
- Newton’s second law is applied using different components: rectangular, tangential and normal, or radial and transverse.
- In analyzing motion, actual bodies (like cars or rockets) can be considered as particles if rotation about their center of mass is negligible.
- Consistent units are essential for problem-solving.
- ## Linear Momentum
- Defined as the product of mass and velocity of a particle (\( L = mv \)).
- Newton’s second law relates the rate of change of linear momentum to the resultant forces acting on the particle.
- This concept is key in analyzing motion under various forces.
- ### Conservation of Angular Momentum
- In the presence of central forces (directed toward or away from a fixed point), angular momentum is conserved.
- Useful in solving problems involving orbital motion under gravitational attraction.
- ## Systems of Units
- Importance of consistent units in applying Newton’s second law.
- SI units (International System of Units) and U.S. customary units are commonly used.
- The choice of units affects the computation of forces, mass, and acceleration.
- ## Equations of Motion
- Fundamental to solving dynamics problems.
- Free-body and kinetic diagrams aid in visualizing and solving these problems.
- The equations of motion can be expressed in different forms depending on the problem: rectangular, tangential and normal, or radial and transverse components.
- ### Rectangular Components
	- Forces and acceleration are resolved into \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) components.
	- Used in analyzing projectile motion and other dynamics problems.
- ### Tangential and Normal Components
- Resolve forces and acceleration along the tangent and normal to the path of motion.
- Essential in analyzing curvilinear motion.
- ### Radial and Transverse Components
- Used for particles moving in a plane with polar coordinates.
- Relevant in problems involving circular motion or varying radial distances.
- ## Conclusion
- Newton's second law and the concept of linear momentum are fundamental in understanding and analyzing the dynamics of particles.
- Proper application requires a good grasp of the concepts, consistent unit systems, and a clear understanding of the forces involved.

- **Appropedia:** [Links to relevant Affine pages]
- **Repository:** [GitLab/GitHub link]
- ## Timeline and Milestones
- **Group Selection & Formation:** *September 12th, 2023* - Giorgio Chassikos, Cameron Brooks, Brett MacDonald, Shelby Mior
- **Establishment of Project Requirements & Scope:** *September 29th, 2023* - Establishment of a realistic and accurate project scope, including technical targets, team roles, responsibilities, and a preliminary project timeline. This initial phase for establishing planning, scheduling, and monitoring of progress, taking into account planned activities and possible project risks.
- **Concept Design Selection:** *October 20th, 2023* - The team must critically evaluate and select a design concept, ensuring it meets technical and cost requirements. This phase requires a detailed validation plan for the concept against specification metrics, moving from theoretical planning to a practical, actionable design strategy encompassing design intricacies, cost-effectiveness, and comprehensive project management.
- **Conceptual Design Review Presentation:** *November 22nd, 2023* - Teams are required to deliver a 20-minute presentation, including a PowerPoint file, to showcase their project's progress and future plans. This presentation should cover an overview of the project, team roles, design specifications, concept selection rationale, a detailed validation plan, adjustments in project timelines, risk management strategies, and the progress of the detailed design. The presentation, judged by university and community judges, should be clear, engaging, and include multimedia elements, with all team members participating and dressed in business attire.

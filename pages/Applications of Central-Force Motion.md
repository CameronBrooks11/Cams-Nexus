# Applications of Central-Force Motion
- ## Trajectory of a Particle Under a Central Force
- **Context**: Focuses on satellite and planetary motions influenced by gravity.
- **Central Force**: Directed towards the center of force, O.
- **Equations of Motion**:
	- Radial Component: \( m(r¨ - rθ^2) = -F \)
	- Transverse Component: \( m(rθ¨ + 2r˙θ˙) = 0 \)
	- These equations describe the motion of particle P under a central force.
- ### Differential Equation for Trajectory
- **Derivation**: Involves eliminating the time variable from the motion equations.
- **Equation**: \( \frac{d^2u}{dθ^2} + u = \frac{F}{mh^2u^2} \), where \( u = \frac{1}{r} \) and \( h \) is the angular momentum per unit mass.
- **Application**: Defines the trajectory followed by a particle under a central force.
- ## Application to Space Mechanics
- **Scenario**: Earth satellites and space vehicles subject only to Earth's gravitational pull after the final rocket stage.
- **Gravitational Force Equation**: \( F = \frac{GMm}{r^2} \), where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M \) is Earth's mass, and \( r \) is the distance from Earth's center.
- **Differential Equation**: \( \frac{d^2u}{dθ^2} + u = \frac{GM}{h^2} \).
- ### Trajectories in Space
	- **Elliptical Trajectories**: Common for satellites, defined by specific initial conditions and velocities.
	- **Escape Velocity**: The minimum velocity required for a satellite not to return to Earth.
	- **Circular Orbit Velocity**: A specific velocity that results in a circular orbit.
- ## Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion
	- **Kepler’s First Law**: Planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus.
	- **Kepler’s Second Law**: The line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
	- **Kepler’s Third Law**: The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.
	- **Application**: These laws apply to planetary motion around the Sun and are derived from the theory of central-force motion.

- Rocketry tasks formalize:
	- Riley: [https://www.printables.com/model/77186-cubesat-v10/files](https://www.printables.com/model/77186-cubesat-v10/files) replicate this on Fusion360 or OnShape. 3D model and corresponding dimensioned 2D drawing for all the parts. Keep in mind this will be stretched length wise to create a 2U which will be interfaced with the normal 1U that the design at the link describes.
	- Nick: [https://github.com/chrisspen/gears](https://github.com/chrisspen/gears) use this lib to come up with 3 variations of planetary gears to test. Consider the size of the payload (ask Jess cross section dimensions), since it needs to fit inside with some tolerance
	- Graham: go onto the rocketry gitlab and clone the repo. Start documenting the designs. Tell him to message me on teams for what he needs.
	- Everyone else: CAD the multi neck flask, help with frame CAD

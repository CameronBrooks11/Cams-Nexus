- Since starting to help with the [[Roto Isolated Thermocouple Driver]] for the [[Rotoforge Project]] I've been looking into advanced tools and methods for high-sped PCB design
	- Learned out [[copper thieving]] while looking for KiCAD tools for this (https://github.com/mrussell42/copper_thief)
	- A good resource for developing boards in [[KiCAD]] using a keyboard as an example: (keyboard-pcb-design)[https://github.com/ruiqimao/keyboard-pcb-guide]
	- I believe [[Antmicro]] has what I've been looking for in their blog on [High-frequency hardware design with open source signal integrity analysis](https://antmicro.com/blog/2023/11/open-source-signal-integrity-analysis/)
		- for this they created (github.com/antmicro/gerber2ems)[https://github.com/antmicro/gerber2ems ] which takes production files and simulates trace signal integrity performance using (openEMS)[https://www.openems.de/]
	- This led to me delving more into [[Antmicro]] and their open hardware-software design flow that uses KiCAD and blender for CI development of hardware

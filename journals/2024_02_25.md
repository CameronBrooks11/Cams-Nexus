- [[Meeting]] with Duke to discuss [[control systems]] for [[Airbrakes Capstone]]
	- Created a simulation based on OpenRocket to add airbrakes
		- Took source code and modifed it to get sims
	- Matrix of flight plan
		- 64x64 matrix at burnout
		- Read current altitude and velocity then select flight plan (velocities and altitutes)
		- PID about that set plan --> just picked 30% and go in and out around that (allows to "speed up" by retracting)
		- Write to serial messed up their stuff?
	- Simulate in anysys
		- Vortex flow around the ends
		-

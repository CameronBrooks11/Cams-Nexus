- [[Airbrakes Capstone]] [[Arduino Portenta H7]] and [[Nicla Sense ME]]
	- For initial set up of scripts and connection between the host (portenta) and client (nicla): https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/nicla-sense-me/cheat-sheet/
	- Need to download/clone https://github.com/arduino/nicla-sense-me-fw
	- Get [Go](https://go.dev/dl/)
	- open the directory **tools/bhy-controller/src** and type:
		- ```
		  go build bhy.go
		  ```
	- After that you will see a new file called **bhy** (.exe if you are on Windows).
	- In terminal navigate to the directory with the newly made bhy.exe and execute the following:
		- ```
		  # list available serial ports
		  bhy.exe list
		  
		  # read available sensor data
		  bhy.exe sensor read -p COMx
		  # continuously read sensor data when available
		  bhy.exe sensor read -live -p COMx
		  # configure sensor 10 with a sample rate of 1 Hz and latency of 0ms
		  bhy.exe sensor config -p COMx -sensor 10 -rate 1 -latency 0
		  # disable sensor 10
		  bhy.exe sensor config -p COM3 -sensor 10 -rate 0 -latency 0
		  ```
